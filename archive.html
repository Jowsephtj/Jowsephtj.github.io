    A critical swing analysis error has occurred, and the Arc Maxim has been shut down to prevent incorrect feedback.
    If this is your first time seeing this error, please restart the analysis. If the issue persists, try these steps:
    Ensure the camera and sensor inputs are properly aligned.
    Verify that all swing data was captured correctly.
    Check for software updates to improve performance.
